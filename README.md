# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Author: Joseph Mandalihan <br />

## Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

### Dataset Description

The project taps into an exciting area of wearable computing, where a number of big brands compete to develop clever algorithms. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script
